# Extras for T v T

I think that it would be good if the first line of each record set was number of matches - this would give some context to the rest of the records (50 matches shows real relevance, 2 matches shows not much relevance).

For all one-day types, I'd like to see something on

1. Best Batting Strike Rate
1. Most Sixes in an Innings
1. Most Fours in an Innings
1. Most boundaries in an Innings

1. Best Bowling Strike Rate
1. Best Bowling Economy Rate
1. Most Expensive Bowling


It would also be good to have
1. Most Runs for X v Y (not sure how to phrase that)
1. Most Wickets for X v Y
1. Most Catches
1. Most Stumpings
 
Where a team has never been all out, could we think about putting a note about lowest total - although that might give us 2-0 where rain stopped play or something, which might mean we really want lowest total in the scheduled overs. Just a thought.



From Keith:

I'm not too troubled by the size and positioning of the number of matches - but would it be possible to show also the dates of the first and last meetings of each pairing (e.g. '18 matches 2000/01-2022/23')?



I'd be in favour of going to two decimal places for strike-rates, economy rates and the like, to be sure of distinguishing the very best (or worst) records. 

But I wonder if there should be some minimum qualification thresholds for each of these items: maybe the batters should have had to score at least 10, or perhaps 20, to qualify for the strike-rate record, and bowlers should have bowled at least 2, and perhaps 3, overs to qualify for their economy-rate and strike-rate records. Otherwise these figures can be hugely skewed by performances in very brief batting or bowling spells.



Alternatively (or would this be making things too detailed?) perhaps we could include both the overall records with no qualification (as at present), and the records on a qualification of (say) 20 runs for a batter, and 3 overs for a bowler.



I hope I'm not over-egging all this, or making life even more hectic for Kevin, but a couple of other possible additions have occurred to me, while we're on this theme:



Highest strike-rates in a team innings (which may not be the same as that achieved during the highest innings total - eg a team chasing 200 and getting them in 15 overs would be likely to have a higher SR than if they had scored more than 200 but taken their full 20 overs to do so).



Lowest strike-rate by a batter scoring at least 10 (or 20) runs. If we can include 'worst economy rates' for bowlers, perhaps we need to even things up and have some equivalent record for batters.
